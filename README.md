# Fruitsense

This project measures fruit maturity and chemical monitoring using a normal smartphone camera. We then perform machine learning on the images to classify the maturity stage of the fruit based on its chlorophyll concentration. We also perform regression using the Rank-N-Contrast method to predict the chemical concentration of the fruit at various maturities.
